									<h3 class="major">Flexbox</h3>
                                    <p>Flexbox is the best! Honestly I found flexbox so much easier than block, inline, and inline-block. I feel like flexbox is how my brain wanted HTML tags to behave all along, so it wasnâ€™t too hard to pick up. Being able to move the flex items around with much simpler properties is much less of a headache than trying to figure out different widths, heights, margins, padding, etc. for every. single. div. The justify-content and align-items properties make positioning elements a breeze!</p>
                                    <p>One important thing to remember with flexbox is that the element in which you do <code>display: flex;</code> is the flex container and the immediate children are the flex items. The flex property is not inherited by the grandchildren as it only goes one level deep. I found <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">CSS Tricks' flexbox guide</a> to be my most helpful resource!</p>
                                    <p>We also learned how  Lambda School's git flow works. It would have been much easier if we had learned the git workflow in the first week because I ended up watching this lesson last week so that I could do my earlier projects on GitHub because doing them on CodePen was a pain.</p>
                                    <p>We had our first Sprint challenge this weekend! In a more traditional educational setting, sprints are kind of like unit tests. We had 3 hours to complete our challenge. This week, we were given provided html, css, and design files. We needed to examine the files and add the header and anything else to make it match the design files. At first, I was really nervous because I wasn't sure if I would be able to finish everything in time. But I felt that the sprint was very realistic and I finished in less than an hour! This gave me time to add some extra features as some extra practice. You can view my finished sprint challenge <a href="https://github.com/jgarrow/Sprint-Challenge--User-Interface">here!</a></p>

									<h3 class="major">Thoughts and Experience</h3>
                                    <p>After completing my first sprint these last two weeks, here are my thoughts and impressions of Lambda School so far! After the first 2 lectures during the first week, I quickly figured out that for me personally, I focus much better when I don't have Slack open and on the same screen as my IDE and Zoom. The constant questions and notifications were really distracting and I found that if I didn't have it on my active screens, I focused much better and got a lot more out of the lessons and guided projects.</p>
                                    <p>I've also be learning to be ok with the fact that I don't know or understand everything that's going on in someone's code. You also don't need to stress about trying to memorize and remember every single HTML tag, CSS property and attribute, Javascript function, etc. The internet is so powerful and can do so much that you're constantly going to be learning. Practice will help you remember the things that you use more often, but even the most experienced software engineers rely on outside resources.</p>
