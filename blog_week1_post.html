									<h3 class="major">Week 1 in the books!</h3>
                                    <p>I am officially a part time, full stack web development student at Lambda School! I'll be documenting what I'm learning, as well as my thoughts and experiences at Lambda School over the course of the next 18 months.</p>
                                    <p>This week, we learned about the box model in HTML that governs how the different tags are laid out in your browser. Content in HTML is put inside tags. These tags essentially act as boxes that hold your content. The box model helps us understand how these boxes are rendered on your screen! There are 4 parts to the box model: content, padding, border, and margin. Our instructor used a great analogy to an actual box, like one you'd get from Amazon. The product or item you ordered is the content. The packing peanuts or bubble wrap is the padding. The cardboard of the box is the border. And the air outside of the box is like the margin. If you set <code>box-sizing: border-box;</code>, the width that you give to your HTML tag will be the width of the whole "Amazon package", so to speak. It will include the content, padding, and size of the border. This is great because then you don't have to do a lot of calculations to figure out the different widths you need to give your padding and content to achieve the total size you want!</p>
                                    <p>A "trick" I learned this week while working on one of my projects is that with HTML elements, you can have text without being in things like p tags or h1 tags. But carriage returns that you input so that your HTML is more readable for the developer will actually show up as extra whitespace on your webpage, extra whitespace that you might not want. To circumvent that, in your CSS you can set <code>font-size: 0;</code> for the element that has that extra space and then reset <code>font-size: initial;</code> for the elements that have text and content that still needs to be displayed.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Thoughts and Experience</h3>
                                    <p>Seeing as it's only been one week (and only half of the first sprint since I'm in part time), I think it's a bit early to give any decisive opinions about Lambda School. There is definitely room for improvement on the communication side, at least with incoming cohorts of students and helping them have all of the information they need to understand what's going on and what is expected of them. But I've chalked these problems up as growing pains. Lambda School has been growing so quickly that they (most likely) have bigger priorities that need to be taken care of first.</p>
                                    <p>But as of right now, here is my understanding of how Lambda School Part Time works! In your track (i.e. Web Development, Data Science, Android Development, etc.), there are 4 units, and each unit is made up of 4 sprints. Each sprint is made up of 4 modules. Since I’m in the part time track, our schedule is a bit different. We spend 2 days on each module: one day is a lecture/guided project where we are all together as an entire cohort on Zoom and our instructor walks through a simple program with us that explores the new concept(s) for that module. And the next class day is time for us to work on our module project on our own (although we are always welcome and encouraged to reach out to our classmates and other resources for help). So 2 modules per week, 4 modules per sprint, 4 sprints for unit, and 4 units in the track comes out to 32 weeks for your core track, with a little bit extra time for holidays.</p>
                                    <p>After you complete your core track, then you move on to Labs. Labs is basically an internship or “in-house apprenticeship”. <a href="https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/how-lambda-school-labs-works-whiteboard-friday">Lambda School’s blog post</a> does a great job explaining the details of Labs. Our part time schedule has us at about 17 weeks, starting the first week of May through the last week of August.</p>
                                    <p>Next comes the Computer Science (Aug 31 - Jan 10), the more theoretical side of software development. And then after completing the Computer Science unit, we move on to Lambda X (starts Jan. 11), which is Lambda School’s great resources of job search/career preparation assistance, coaches and mentors, as well as programming practice to keep your skills sharp. So as far as learning and curriculum go, my cohort started on Sept. 3, 2019 and we finish on Jan. 10, 2021, a total of about 70 weeks, not including any flex weeks or Lambda X.</p>
